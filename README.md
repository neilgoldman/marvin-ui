Ionic 2 (Web/Mobile) App for my home automation.

I needed a reliable interface for my home automation project while I improve the accuracy on my voice-control project. Only optimized for a landscape-oriented tablet right now. I really like Ionic v1 and Angular1, so this project is an excuse to try Ionic 2 / Angular 2 / TypeScript. I also wants it to be both, a native app, and a webpage on my local network. 

So far only the dashboard (basically a lightswitch mode) is functional. Check out app/pages/page1/page1.ts
